Due to Minecraft's nature of refactors for the past decade (which is normal for all apps), we have decided to refactor the codebase to make it more maintainable and practical. This will also take us in other versions of Minecraft.

We will be working on this in the next few weeks trying to improve both the codebase and the user experience.

## Goals
- ðŸ“– Document every change done to the code, both in discord and in the github wiki, this is mandatory.
- ðŸ§© Separate as much code from Minecraft as possible (abstractions), important for adding other versions.
- ðŸŽ¨ Make the UI as customizable as possible, good for user experience, we should keep this in mind.

For updates, check out our [Discord](https://discord.gg/HFRsNxfCqT) or [GitHub issue](https://github.com/saturnclientmc/saturnclient/issues/1)
